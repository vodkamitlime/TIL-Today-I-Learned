# Signal

## Background
- Software interrupts that provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous events 
- Interrupt: Unexpected external event, asynchronous event
- Sequence
    1. Interrupts occurs
    2. Process terminates (kernel intervenes)
    3. Interrupt handling
        4. Finds interrupt cause
        5. Decides whether to servicce interrupt
        6. Calls Interrupt service routine

## Life Cycle of Signal
- Raise
    - Exception in program (ex. divide by zero)
    - User input (ex. keyboard)
    - Created & delivered by process/kernel
