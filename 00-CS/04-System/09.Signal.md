# Signal

## Background
- Software interrupts that provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous events 
- Interrupt: Unexpected external event, asynchronous event
- Sequence
    1. Interrupts occurs
    2. Process terminates (kernel intervenes)
    3. Interrupt handling
        4. Finds interrupt cause
        5. Decides whether to servicce interrupt
        6. Calls Interrupt service routine

## Life Cycle of Signal
- Raise
    - Exception in program (ex. divide by zero)
    - User input (ex. keyboard)
    - Created & delivered by process/kernel
- Store
    - Kernel stores signal until it is delivered to another process
    - When it becomes available for delivery, it is delivered to other process
- Handle
    - There are many ways to handle the signal
        1. Ignore the signal
        2. Catch/handle the signal
        3. Perform the default action

## Signals in Unix/Linux
- Symbolic constants (map to number)
    - `#include <signal.h>`
    - `man -s 7 signal`
    - Signal number may differ according to system (Use symbolic constants)
- Pending signals: Signals that are not handled yet
