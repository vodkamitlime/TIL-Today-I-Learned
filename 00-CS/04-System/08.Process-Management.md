# Process Management

## Running a new process
- Executing a new program
    - Read the binary of a program and overwrite the memory area of the process that called itself
    - Original program is stopped
- Creating a new process
    - Copies parent process to a new child process
    - Forking: Can be executed through `fork()` system call
    - Inherits: Information in memory
        - RUID, EUID, RGID, EGID, setuid, setgid
        - Env variables, Opened file descriptors
        - Working directory, Signal handling setup, resource limit, etc
    - Child's unique information
        - PID, PPID
        - TMS Structure
        - Resource information (Resource statics, pending signals, etc...)

## Terminating a process
- When process is terminted, exit status is saved
    - 0 means normal termination
    - Can deliver child process' exit status to parent
- `exit(int status)`
    - status = exit status to deliver to parent process
- Process termination sequence
    - Executes functions registered in `atexit(3)` in reverse order of registration
    - Flushes all contents of Standard IO
    - Deletes all temporal file (`tmpfile()`)
    - Calls `_exit(2)` -> After this, kernel continues on with termination process
        - Closes file descriptors in use
        - Sends exit status to parent process
        - Sends SIGCHLD to child process
        - Sends SIGUP to parent process
        - Returns resources used by process 
- `atexit(void (*function)(void))`
    - Registers functions to be called at exit() or return to main()

## Process Synchronization
- Multi programming system
    - Has multiple processes (independent of each other)
    - Shared resources may cause problems
- Synchronization
    - Processes sharing information, agreeing on specific actions
- Zombie Process/State
    - Process which is terminated, but is not deleted yet
    - When child process is terminated before parent, it is zombie process
        - Resources are returned
        - But minimum information is kept at kernel (ex. exit status)
        - Remains in zombie state until parent receives the exit status
