## High Level File I/O (Standard I/O)

### Disk Address
- Physical address
    - defines sector (cyliner number, surface number, sector number)
- Logical disk address (relative address)
    - treats disk system's data as block sequence
        - numbers blocks
        - is able to access number
- Address mapping
    - OS -> (Block #) -> Disk Driver -> (Physical Addr) -> Disk controller

### Block
- Abstraction of the file system
- 512 ~ 8192 bytes
- sector size < Block Size < Page Size 
- Minimum unit of disk (block) access

### File IO vs Disk IO
- File IO
    - Access in a unit of byte
- Disk IO
    - Access in a unit of block
