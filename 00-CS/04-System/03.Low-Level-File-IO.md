# File I/O

## File
- Sequence of bytes
- OS has to provide system call for file operations

## Types of Files in Unix/Linux
- Regular File
    - Text or binary data file
- Directory
    - Directory is counted as file in Unix/Linux
- Special File
    - Object in kernel that is expressed as file format (ex. resource)
    - file used for data transmission & device access (ex. device files, pipes, socket)

## File commands
- ls
    - list
    - print file list in current directory
    - options
        - -l: details
        - -a: hidden files (all)
- touch
    - creates empty file (new) or changes timestamp (if already exists)
- rm 
    - removes file 
    - options
        - -r: remove directory
- cat
    - concatenate
    - print file contents
- cp
    - copy
    - options
        - -r: copy directory
- mv
    - move
    - move file or change name
- chmod
    - change mode
    - change file access
    - chmod [bits] [filename]
        - bits are expressed in octary numbers
        - ex. chmod 222 permission
        - binary rwx 010 -> is value 2 in octary
        - 222 means write permission is given for all users
    - chmod [string] [filename]
        - permission given for specific user
        - ex. chmod u+r permission
        - read permission given to user

## File Access permissions
- Owner, Group, others
- r (read), w (write), x (execute)
- Expressed in bits
    - 3 bits: Owner's rwx access
    - 3 bits: Group's rwx access
    - 3 bits: Others' rwx access
    - ex: rwxrw-r--
