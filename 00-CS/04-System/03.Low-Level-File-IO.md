# File I/O

## File
- Sequence of bytes
- OS has to provide system call for file operations

## Types of Files in Unix/Linux
- Regular File
    - Text or binary data file
- Directory
    - Directory is counted as file in Unix/Linux
- Special File
    - Object in kernel that is expressed as file format (ex. resource)
    - file used for data transmission & device access (ex. device files, pipes, socket)

## File commands
- ls
    - list
    - print file list in current directory
    - options
        - -l: details
        - -a: hidden files (all)
- touch
    - creates empty file (new) or changes timestamp (if already exists)
- rm 
    - removes file 
    - options
        - -r: remove directory
- cat
    - concatenate
    - print file contents
- cp
    - copy
    - options
        - -r: copy directory
- mv
    - move
    - move file or change name
- chmod
    - change mode
    - change file access
    - chmod [bits] [filename]
        - bits are expressed in octary numbers
        - ex. chmod 222 permission
        - binary rwx 010 -> is value 2 in octary
        - 222 means write permission is given for all users
    - chmod [string] [filename]
        - permission given for specific user
        - ex. chmod u+r permission
        - read permission given to user

## File Access permissions
- Owner, Group, others
- r (read), w (write), x (execute)
- Expressed in bits
    - 3 bits: Owner's rwx access
    - 3 bits: Group's rwx access
    - 3 bits: Others' rwx access
    - ex: rwxrw-r--

## Low-level vs High-level file IO
- Low level file IO
    - system calls
    - uses file descriptor
    - writes on disk with byte units
    - IO on special files
- High level file IO
    - IO through C standard library
    - use File pointers
    - writes on disk with buffer units

## File open/close
### Open
- system call for open: `open`
- `int open(const char *pathname, int flags [, mode_t mode])
- pathname: path for file to open
- flags: access mode (r/w)
    - can combine multiple flags with OR bit operation (|)
    - ex. O_RDONLY, O_CREAT, O_APPEND, ...
- mode: file access permission (only valid when new file created)
    - sets permission for page
    can use predefined flags tha can be combined with OR bit operation (|)
    ex. S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR
- returns file descriptor

### Close
- system call for close: `close`
- `int close(int fd)
- fd: file descriptor for file to close
- returns 0 (success) or -1 (error)

## File Read/Write
### Read
- system call for read: `read`
- `ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)
- fd: fild descriptor of file to read
- buf: starting address of buffer to save read contents
- count: bytes to read
- returns: actual bytes read
    - 0: EOF
    - -1: Error

### Write
- system call for write: `write`
- `ssize_t write(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)
- fd: fild descriptor of file to write
- buf: starting address of buffer that has contents to write
- count: bytes to write
- returns: actual bytes written
    - -1: Error

### File offset (file position)
- position to apply operation (read/write)
- byte count from start of file till current point
- After Read(2)/Write(2), moves in amount of bytes read/written

### File access methods
- Sequential access 
    - accesses file sequentially by record (or bytes)
    - ex. fgetc()
- Directed access
    - accesses file block directly
    - lseek()
        - `off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence)`
        - fd: file descriptor of target
        - offset: byte number to move (+, -)
        - whence: location
            - SEEK_SET: start of file
            - SEEK_CUR: current location
            - SEEK_END: end of file
        - returns: file offset after move
            - -1: error
    - seek()
- Indexed access
    - gets block through index and accesses data

## Page Cache & Write-back
- Page cache
    - In-memory store of recently accessed data from an on-disk fs
    - kernel mecahnism to save access time from disk
- Page write-back
    - applying changes in page cache to disk
    - kernel decides when to apply
    - system call to force page write back: `fsync()`
        - `int fsync(int fd)`
        - fd: file descriptor of target
        - returns 0 (success), -1 (error)

## File Descriptor
- Integer to determine open files
    - available for all files
    - kernel manages them process by process
- Allocated sequentially when files are opened
    - max fd num for each process (by default): 1024
- Default fds (but are modifiable)
    - 0: stdin
    - 1: stdout
    - 2: stderr 
- Duplicating fd
    - `int dup(int oldfd)`
    - `int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd)`
    - oldfd: fd to copy
    - newfd: new fd, in case of dup() smallest fd among available ones is allocated
    - returns: fd that is copy of oldfd
        - -1: error
- Manipulating fd
    - `int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, /*arg..*/)`
    - fd: file descriptor of target
    - cmd: command
        - F_GETFL (read status flag), F_SETFL (set status flag)
    - arg (argument)
        - arguments needed for cmd
    - return: differs by cmd

### File Table
- Table to manage open files
- kernel keeps one by process
- Manages information about open files (access mode, file offset, pointer to files...)
