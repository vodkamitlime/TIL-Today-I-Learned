# Process Information

## Process
- Program: Program + Data
    - State before being run by computer command
- Process: Running program
    - Task that is registered in system(kernel)
    - Managed by kernel
    - Process is allocated Memory:
        - Heap Memory
        - Stack Memory (auto variable)
        - Data Segment (Static variable)
        - Text/Code Segment (Program)
- Shell commands
    - `ps` 
        - Process information of currently running processes
        - `-u`: process of specific user
        - `-j`: prints pid, pgid, sid
    - `top`
        - Real time information of system's process information
    - `kill`
        - Sends signal to process
        - `-signal pid`

## Process Hierarchy
- Process id
    - unique id for each process used for identification
- Parent process
    - process that created itself
    - All process has parent process
    - Topmost process = kernel (pid = 0)
    - Parent process id = ppid
- Process group
    - Group of related processes
    - Processes that serve for one identical task (ex. shell script commands, parent-child processes)
    - Signal sent to process group is sent to all processes in the group
    - Process group leader
        - one of the processes included in the group
    - PGID (process group id)
        - PGID = PID of group leader
    - Able to change group via `setpgid` command
        - `int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid)`
        - Only possible within processes in same session
        - if pid set to 0, current process
        - if pgid set to 0, set pgid to pid
- Session
    - Group of related processes in unit of logged in terminal
    - Has 1 foreground group, 0+ background group
    - Foreground process group
        - Process group that receives user input
        - Receives signal from terminal
    - Background process group
        - Other processes besides fg pg
        - Output printed in terminal
    - Session leader
        - login shell process

## Process Execution time
- System running time + User running time
- System running time = Time used to execute kernel code (time to run system call)
- User running time = Time used to execute user written code

## Process environment variables
- Variables defined in system execution environment (ex. shell)
    - Login name, password, pathname, etc...
- Commands
    - `env`: check list of env variables
    - `$export varname=value`: define env variable
        - add this command to .bashrc file to define it automatically at login time 
- If an env variable is added by a process, the variable is only viable within itself and its child processes
    - Not viable in parent process (=shell)
