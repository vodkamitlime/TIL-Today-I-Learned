# Process Information

## Process
- Program: Program + Data
    - State before being run by computer command
- Process: Running program
    - Task that is registered in system(kernel)
    - Managed by kernel
    - Process is allocated Memory:
        - Heap Memory
        - Stack Memory (auto variable)
        - Data Segment (Static variable)
        - Text/Code Segment (Program)
- Shell commands
    - `ps` 
        - Process information of currently running processes
        - `-u`: process of specific user
        - `-j`: prints pid, pgid, sid
    - `top`
        - Real time information of system's process information
    - `kill`
        - Sends signal to process
        - `-signal pid`

## Process Hierarchy
- Process id
    - unique id for each process used for identification
- Parent process
    - process that created itself
    - All process has parent process
    - Topmost process = kernel (pid = 0)
    - Parent process id = ppid
