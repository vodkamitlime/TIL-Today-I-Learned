# I/O System

## I/O Mechanisms
- Processor (CPU) controlled memory access
    - Pooling
        - Processor regularly checks I/O devices' condition and receives data if available
        - State of readiness, state of transmission, etc..
        - Pros: simple & efficient (if I/O devices are fast and frequent data transmission)
        - Cons: Highg overhead for Processor
    - Interrupt
        - After I/O devices finishes task, it sends its state to Processor
        - When interrupt occurs, processor sends data
        - Pros: Low overhead (compared to pooling) / apt for irregular task hadnling
        - Cons: Interrupt handling overhead
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)
    - Sends data between I/O device and Memory directly (without processor intervention)

## I/O Services of OS
- I/O Scheduling
    - Handles order of I/O requests
        - Increases system efficiency
        - Equal treatment of process' request
- Error handling
    - Disk access fail, network communication error, etc..
- I/O device information managements
- Buffering
    - Saves data sent by I/O device and program temporarily in Buffer
    - solves problem of discrepancy of transmission speed (or execution unit)
- Caching
    - Saves frequently used data
    - In cases of cache hit, I/O can be ignored
- Spooling
    - When many programs send requests to one I/O device, mechanism to prevent output from being mixed up (ex. print requests from multiple PCs to one printer)
    - Writes on disk file that matches each program
    - Once spooling is done, sends spools one at a time to I/O device

## Disk Scheduling
- Decides disk access requests' execution order
- Improves preformance of disk system
- Evaluation standards
    - Throughput (amount handled per time)
    - Mean response time
    - Predictability (ability to predict response time, prevents infinite starvation)
- Optimizing Seek time
    - FCFS (First come first serve)
        - Pros: simple / equal request execution
        - Cons: No consideration for best performance
        - Apt for low disk access load
    - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
        - Executes request closest to current head first
        - Pros: High throughput, low mean response time
        - Cons: Low predictability, possibility of starvation
    - Scan scheduling
        - In current head direction, executes request closes to head
        - After last arriving at cylinder, goes back in opposite direction
        - Pros: solves starvation of SSTF / High throughput and mrt
        - Cons: High response time of requests located in end of opposite direction
    - C-Scan
        - Head only turns in predefined direction
        - After arriving at last cylinder, goes back to start cylinder and restarts
        - Pros: provides equal opportunities
    - Look scheduling
        - aka Elevator algorithm
        - In scan, if there is no requests in current direction, change direction
        - Doesn't move to last cylinder
    - SLTF (Shortest latency time first)
        - Used for fixed head disk system
        - No movment of head
        - Sector queuing algorithm
            - Each sector has queue
            - Executes request of queue of sector under head
    - SPTF (Shortest positioning time first)
        - Positioining time = seek time + rotational delay
        - Executes request of smaller positioning time first
        - Pros: High throughput, low mrt
        - Cons: Starvation of innermost and outermost cylinder
        - Escehnbach scheduling
            - Orders request so that disk can execute all requests in one turn

## RAID Architecture
- Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
- Uses multiple physical disks to one logical disk
- Used to increase disk system performance

### RAID 0
- Disk striping
    - Divides one logical block into certian sizes and saves them in each disk
- All disk is distributed equal I/O load
    - Parallel acces
    - High performance
- If one disk is disabled, data is lost

### RAID 1
- Disk mirroring 
    - Saves same data in mirroring disk
- Composes of at least 2 disks
    - I/O is possible in any
- High reliability (no data is lost even if one disk is broken)
- Usable disk space = (all disk space / 2)

### RAID 3
- RAID 0 + parity disk
- Saves data in byte units
- All disk is equally distibuted I/O load
- If one disk is broken, party information is used to restore it
- In cases of write, need consideration for parity

## RAID 4
- similar to RAID 3 but saves in block units

## RAID 5
- similar to RAID 4
- Saves partiy information in each disk
