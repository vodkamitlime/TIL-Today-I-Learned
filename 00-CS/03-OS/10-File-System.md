# File System

## Disk System
- File is saved in disk
- Disk pack
    - Saves data permanently
    - Consists of Sector, Track, Cylinder, Platter, Surface
- Disk drive
    - Device that is composed to read data from disk pack
    - Consists of Head, Arm, Positioner, Spindle
- Disk Address
    - Physical disk address (decides sector, physical data transmission unit)
    - Logical disk address (relative address, divides disk system data into blocks and applies numbers on them)
    - How to translate logical -> physical address? 
        - Drivers
- OS -- (Block #) --> Drivers -- (Physical Address) --> Disk Controller
- Data Access in Disk System
    - Seek Time (time to move disk head to cylinder)
    - Rotational delay (time it takes for sector to move to head)
    - Data transmission time (time it takes to read sector)

## File System
- part of OS that manages files used by users
- Structure
    - Files
    - Directory Structure
    - Partitions
- File Concept
    - Sum of related information that is saved on disk
    - Minimum unit of disk allocation
    - Sequence of bytes
- Classification
    - Of content: Program file / Data file
    - Of structure: Text file / Binary file
- File attributes
    - Name
    - Identifier
    - Type
    - Location
    - Size
    - Protection
    - User identification (owner)
    - Time, date
- File operations (provided by OS through system call)
    - Create
    - Write
    - Read
    - Reposition
    - Delete
- File access methods
    - Sequential access: accesses file by record (or bytes) sequentially
    - Directed access: accesses wanted block directly
    - Indexed access: references index and accesses data after finding wanted block
- File system organization
    - Partitions (minidisks, volumes)
        - virtual disk
    - Directory 
        - concept to classify and store files
- Mounting
    - attaching current FS to another FS
    - mount point
