## Process Synchronization and Mutual Exclusion

### Background
- Multi-programming system has many processes that work independently
- Synchronization: mechanism in which processes share information with each other
- Asynchronous: state where processes do not have information about each other
- Concurrence: state where many processes are existing in a system at the same time
- When concurrent asynchronous processes are accessing a shared resource, this could lead to a problem

### Mutual Exclusion
- primitives
    1. **EnterCS()** primitive: checks if there is another process in critical section before entering
    2. **ExitCS()** primitive: system alerts when exits critical section
- Requirements for ME primitives
    - **Mutual exclusion** : if a process exists in critical section, other processes should be refrained from entering
    - **Progress** : other processes besides the process that exists in the critical section should not interrupt them from entering the critical section
    - **Bounded waiting** : processesâ€™ time allowed within critical section should be finite
- How to guarantee all three of the primitives?
